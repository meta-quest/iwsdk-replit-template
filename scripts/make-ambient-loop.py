"""Generate public/audio/ambient-loop.wav — a seamless ambient pad.

The template needs a background-music asset that ships with the repo and has no
licensing strings attached, so we synthesise one instead of vendoring a track.

Seamlessness: every partial and every LFO uses a frequency that is an exact
multiple of 1 / LOOP_SECONDS, so sample 0 and sample N are phase-continuous and
the file loops with no click.

Swap the output for your own music whenever you like — keep the filename or
update the `ambientMusic` entry in `src/index.ts`.

Usage:  python3 scripts/make-ambient-loop.py
